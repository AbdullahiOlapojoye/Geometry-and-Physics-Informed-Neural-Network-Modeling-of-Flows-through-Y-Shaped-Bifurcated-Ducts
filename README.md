## [----Updating-----]
One of the most difficult problem in bio-mechanical engineering is the quantification of velocity and pressure fields in biological structures exposed to peristaltic flows. An example is the Y-shaped bifurcated structures found in lung capillaries, breast ductal system, ureter and aorta. The dynamic nature of the boundary conditions, geometry complexities and computational cost has limited the use of computational tools such as Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD), Fluid structure interactions(FSI) and Finite Element Analysis(FEA) to solve such problems. Machine learning(ML) is a new framework that can be used to solve such complex problems while overcoming the limitations of existing computational tools. ML does not require the cost-intensive mesh generation and cumbersome definition of boundary conditions needed by traditional solvers.
