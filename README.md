## [----Updating-----]
One of the most difficult problem in bio-mechanical engineering is the quantification of velocity and pressure fields in biological structures exposed to peristaltic flows. An example is the Y-shaped bifurcated structures found in lung capillaries, breast ductal system, ureter and aorta. The dynamic nature of the boundary conditions, geometry complexities and computational cost has limited the use of computational tools such as Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD), Fluid structure interactions(FSI) and Finite Element Analysis(FEA) to solve such problems. Machine learning(ML) is a new framework that can be used to solve such complex problems while overcoming the limitations of existing computational tools. ML does not require the cost-intensive mesh generation and cumbersome definition of boundary conditions needed by traditional solvers. In this study, we developed a Geometry-guided Physics-informed neural networks(G-PINN) model to predict the flow patterns in bio-distensible structures. This model is encoded with non-linear partial differential equations governing fluid flow and the knowledge of the geometry. A periodic velocity-inlet boundary condition at the parent duct of Y-shaped bifurcated ducts was employed in conjunction with sparse velocity data to predict the flows in the daughter ducts. The predictions made by our model was compared to results obtained from proven CFD simulations and we found out that our model predicted the velocity and pressure fields in daughter vessels with high accuracy. The results of the simulation demonstrates great potential of the proposed G-PINN framework for flow predictions in complex geometries subjected to dynamic boundary conditions
